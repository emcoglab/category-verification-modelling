# All of these will be submitted with CCA-attenuation at 0, .5 and 1.
# Note to self: for thresholds we want ling ling <= sm ling <= sm sm <= ling sm.
#   So I'm moving all these to the bottom of the spec

# With the following we want the longer SOA.
# This hasn't provided the best models in the past, but (something like it) is required for plausible model behaviour.

# A previously workable model with less linguistic decay and more sensorimotor decay
